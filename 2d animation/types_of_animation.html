						<div>
						<h5 style=" float:left;">1. Frame By Frame Animation</h5><br><br><br><br><br>
						<p>Frame-by-frame animation changes the contents of the Stage in every frame and is best suited to complex animation in which an image changes in every frame instead of simply moving across the Stage. Frame-by-frame animation increases file size more rapidly than tweened animation. In frame-by-frame animation, Animate CC (formerly Flash Professional CC) stores the values for each complete frame. To create a frame-by-frame animation, we should define each frame as a keyframe and create a different image for each frame. Each new keyframe initially contains the same contents as the keyframe preceding it, so we can modify the frames in the animation incrementally.

						</div>
						
						<div>
						<h5 style=" float:left;">2. Rotoscoping</h5><br><br><br><br><br>
						<p>Rotoscoping is the rotated projection of a sequence of usually photographed action image frames so that the artist can trace from the frame or create an image to superimpose on it. It can be thought of as "painting on movies" efficiently. Prior to computers, an animation stand called a Rotoscope was used to project a sequence of action frames against a surface so that a set of animation frames could be traced or created. The same work can now be done with digital images and special computer software. Tools that provide efficient ways to rotoscope include Digital Magic and Elastic Reality. Rotoscoping is frequently used as a technique for combining (compositing) cartoon figures with realistic settings in television commercials and is also used for special effects in feature-length films.<p>

						</div>
						
						<div>
						<h5 style="float:left;">3. Cut-Out animation</h5><br><br><br><br><br>
						<p>Cut-out animation is one of the oldest and simplest animation techniques and has many forms and variations. Essentially, cut-out animation involves producing animations using 2-D characters, props and scenes cut from materials, such as paper, card or fabric. Animators divide characters into smaller segments, piece together the individual cut-out shapes and move them in small steps, taking a picture -- with a film camera capable of taking single pictures -- at each step, to create the illusion of movement. Animators typically have more difficulty controlling movement in cut-out animation than in full cel animation, in which characters and scenes are drawn or painted on transparent celluloid sheets, so they need to plan the action accordingly. Cut-out animation lends itself well to decisive, rapid movement or even frenzied, continuous action, which disguises some of the limitations of cut-out characters. Cut-out animation is also a highly personal experience; the animator essentially portrays a character, mood or idea just by moving cut-out shapes around, using only his judgment and experience to do so.<p>

                    <div id="ik">
						<div class="image-ik">
							<img src="images/ik.gif" style="float:right;width:350px; height:300px; margin-left:50px; margin-top:50px;">
						</div>
                		<div>
						<h5 style="float:left;">4. Rigged Charecter with IK</h5><br><br><br><br><br>
						<p>Software like Toon Boom or Animation Studio have ay lot of tools that help you rig a character with inverse kinematics and automate facial expressions.Inverse kinematics are the opposite of forward kinematics (used in Cut Out animation). In Cut Out animation, if you need the hand to be in a position, you have to rotate the shoulder, then forearm and so on. Inverse Kinematics let you click on the hand and move it to the position you want, and the positions and rotations of the shoulder, arm and forearm are automatically calculated by mathematical formulas.<p>
